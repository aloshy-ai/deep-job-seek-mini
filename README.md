# 🚀 Deep Job Seek Mini

AI-powered resume generation with HuggingFace native models. This is a streamlined version of the full [Deep Job Seek API](https://github.com/aloshy-ai/deep-job-seek) optimized for HuggingFace Spaces.

## ✨ Features

- **🤖 AI-Powered**: Uses HuggingFace transformers for intelligent resume generation
- **🔍 Semantic Matching**: Sentence transformers for finding relevant experience
- **📄 JSON Resume Schema**: Generates standardized, professional resumes
- **⚡ Fast & Free**: Runs entirely on HuggingFace infrastructure
- **🎯 Tailored Content**: Customizes resumes based on specific job descriptions

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Input**: Paste any job description
2. **Analysis**: AI extracts key requirements and skills
3. **Matching**: Semantic search finds relevant experience from resume database
4. **Generation**: Creates tailored resume in JSON Resume format
5. **Output**: Professional, customized resume ready for applications

## 🧠 Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Gradio for beautiful, interactive UI
- **AI Models**: 
  - `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5` for semantic embeddings
  - `microsoft/DialoGPT-medium` for text generation
- **Backend**: Pure Python with HuggingFace transformers
- **Data**: Curated resume database with diverse professional profiles

## 🚀 Usage

1. **Enter Job Description**: Paste the job posting you're applying for
2. **Click Generate**: Let AI analyze and create your tailored resume
3. **Download Result**: Get JSON Resume format for further customization

### Example Job Descriptions

Try these examples to see the AI in action:

- "Senior Python Developer with Flask experience, 5+ years building REST APIs, Docker expertise required"
- "DevOps Engineer specializing in AWS, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines with 3+ years experience"  
- "Full-Stack Developer proficient in React, Node.js, and PostgreSQL for e-commerce applications"

## 📊 Sample Output

The AI generates resumes following the [JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org/) standard:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jsonresume/resume-schema/v1.0.0/schema.json",
  "basics": {
    "name": "AI-Generated Candidate",
    "email": "candidate@example.com",
    "summary": "Experienced professional with expertise in Python, Flask, Docker..."
  },
  "work": [...],
  "skills": [...],
  "projects": [...]
}
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

This Space demonstrates a simplified architecture perfect for demos and quick prototypes:

```
User Input → Job Analysis → Semantic Search → AI Generation → JSON Resume
     ↓              ↓              ↓              ↓              ↓
 Gradio UI → Text Processing → Embeddings → HF Models → Formatted Output
```

## 💡 Use Cases

- **Job Seekers**: Quickly generate tailored resumes for applications
- **Recruiters**: Understand how AI can match candidates to roles
- **Developers**: Learn about semantic search and AI resume generation
- **Students**: Explore practical applications of NLP and transformers

## 🚦 Limitations

- **Demo Data**: Uses sample resume profiles (not real candidates)
- **Model Size**: Optimized for speed over complexity
- **Free Tier**: Subject to HuggingFace Spaces usage limits
- **English Only**: Currently supports English job descriptions
